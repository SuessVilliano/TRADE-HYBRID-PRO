# Trade Hybrid Pro - Enhanced Implementation Plan 2025-2026

## 1. Platform Core Components Integration

Based on our enhanced blueprint, we'll focus on tightly integrating these core components:

- **Solana Validator + THC/SOL Staking**: Unified staking experience for both SOL and THC tokens
- **Nexus Router**: Advanced multi-broker trade execution system (evolution of current Nexus)
- **Webhook Automation**: Expanded AI-driven trading with flexible integration points
- **Prop Firm Evaluation**: New system to identify and fund top-performing traders
- **Internal Wallet System**: Seamless trading and staking integration
- **AI Signals + Trade Journal**: Comprehensive trade tracking and performance analytics

## 2. Server Migration & Infrastructure Plan

### EX101 Server Configuration
- Base OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Server stack:
  - Node.js for backend services
  - PM2 for process management
  - NGINX as reverse proxy and static file server
  - SSL via Certbot
  - PostgreSQL database (or Supabase for managed solution)
