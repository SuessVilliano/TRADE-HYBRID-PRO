All right I see a few updates but nothing major because the while BTC is able to switch I have to scroll and choose and I should be able to search and start typing in in all of trading views you know everything comes up but there's no futures here there's no Solana I do see Solana sorry about that but like is limited and who wants to scroll isn't there a search option and another thing you'll notice that the drop-down button is in the way for Bitcoin like it's on the chart so you can't hit the plus sign you can't use the chart because you've put the search box on the chart you put the numbers one the month the weeks and everything on the chart when there's actually space if you look at the top to rhythmic there's actually space up there and yeah really there's space right up there for for that to go because I want to be able to use I want to be able to change the chart from on the chart like trading view like where you see it's covered up Bitcoin is covered up with ours one minute five minute 1530 we would be able to change the chart and that would be exceptional and that should change everything so find a way to get a search box in there and find a way to get that box out of the way of the chart so we can actually see it and also to the right we can't take screenshots actually yeah we can I'm sorry let's just just make sure that everything is clean you see how everything is lined up the pro tip customize your dashboard again this still doesn't show I can't see that bottom part of the borders in front of it there is no widgets there's no ad widget section on here I don't see anything to add so we can't add those to a add trade assistant still scroll doesn't go all the way down when it's on a spot or futures or when it's on trade inbox platforms when I click the button to the right on platforms it stops at DX trade it doesn't show I can't scroll down to see the other two like I previously could and on AI assistant the AI chat box you can't scroll down to utilize on desktop the share button doesn't work the bookmark button doesn't work save as default button doesn't work in the help button doesn't work so they're all like useless that's honestly probably where you should put the symbol drop down because other other than me using it on a chart if I have to search and stuff you should put that search button up there with the time minute like a smart like smart features you could put that up in that area where share bookmark save as default is because that area is useless and then get the the widget codes that I put in I want that there and again when I click DX trade like on the chart it trade GUI refuses to connect so I'm not sure how that's loaded but get that working so it actually loads and when I click market analysis the top it just crashes
