I'm over here thinking of, you know, ways to ensure that this app is the greatest and I'm thinking about, all right, so if I'm going to an investor, you know, I want an investor to invest in this. What are the ways people make money? Subscription-based. All right, subscription-based, so what are they paying into? They want to pay for access to our AI that knows, you know, essentially everything, like smart, and not only does it know new information, it's learning them and their habits to help tailor it to them to make them the best trader and hold them accountable and be like their trade companion, kind of like their, you know, their right hand, kind of like their manager, smart money manager, so that alone is worth a subscription. And then if we find a way to sell our strategies and indicators, we could do a performance-based where, you know, or a monthly subscription and it has to be in trade hybrid for you to get access to it, so a different tier, something could be performance-based, then where there's no monthly fee that you have to pay in trade hybrid coin, it's just a percentage of what we make, then it may be zero, it should be interchangeable, the whole platform should allow for traders to come in and create their copy trade experience, kind of like any trade, A-N-N-Y.trade allows you to use APIs to trade, copy it, and trade on other people's, because it's all API-based, so the subscription could be with the AI and the AI data, the AI model, the AI information that is given through when they sign up, and then we can do the coin, it can be a part of the prescription, performance-based, also when transactions happen on the network, kind of get like our own swap fees going, because it's with Solano, and then eventually we could be a Solano aggregator, so we build our own aggregator and people decide to stake and swap the Solano coin, long as we're the aggregator, it's on our platform, so we're earning as people stake, so that's a way for investors to earn too, and then ultimately trade challenges, things we do when we gamify the network, live events, and then from payouts from the brokers, from us getting people to use their platforms, from like broker affiliates, from people signing up to the brokers through us.
