Got it! You want your Trade Hybrid app to:
	1.	Pull trade signals in real time from Google Sheets via the Sheets API.
	2.	Continuously check live or historical market data to see if Stop Loss (SL) or Take Profit (TP) levels are hit.
	3.	Update the Google Sheet automatically when SL or TP levels are reached.

High-Level Plan for Real-Time Trade Monitoring

1. Data Sources:
	•	Trade Signals: Pulled from Google Sheets (entry time, price, SL, TP levels).
	•	Market Data:
	•	Live Data (via TradingView, NinjaTrader API, or a broker API).
	•	Historical Data (for backtesting).

2. Logic to Check Trade Outcomes
	•	Monitor each trade in real time.
	•	If price reaches Stop Loss, mark the trade as “Stopped Out”.
	•	If price reaches a Take Profit level, mark which level was hit.
	•	If price continues without hitting either, keep monitoring.

3. Update Google Sheets in Real Time
	•	As soon as an outcome is determined, update the respective row in Google Sheets.

⸻

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Run this in your Replit environment:

pip install pandas gspread oauth2client requests time



⸻

Step 2: Set Up Google Sheets API

Same as before:
	•	Enable the Google Sheets API.
	•	Create a Service Account and download the JSON key.
	•	Share your Google Sheet with the service account email.

⸻

Step 3: Live Trade Monitoring Script

Create real_time_signals.py

import pandas as pd
import gspread
import requests
import time
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

# Google Sheets API setup
SCOPE = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
CREDS = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name("google_api_credentials.json", SCOPE)
client = gspread.authorize(CREDS)

# Open the trade signals sheet
SPREADSHEET_NAME = "Your_Trade_Signals_Sheet"
sheet = client.open(SPREADSHEET_NAME).worksheet("Sheet1")

# API for Live Market Data (Modify this to use NinjaTrader, TradingView, etc.)
MARKET_DATA_API = "https://api.example.com/marketdata"  # Replace with actual data source

# Function to fetch live market price
def get_live_price(symbol):
    response = requests.get(f"{MARKET_DATA_API}?symbol={symbol}")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return float(response.json().get("price"))
    return None

# Function to check trade outcomes
def check_trade_outcome(trade, live_price):
    entry_price = trade['Entry Price']
    stop_loss = trade['Stop Loss']
    take_profits = [trade[col] for col in trade.index if "Take Profit" in col and pd.notna(trade[col])]

    if live_price <= stop_loss:
        return "Stopped Out"
    
    for i, tp in enumerate(take_profits):
        if live_price >= tp:
            return f"Take Profit {i+1} Hit"

    return "Trade Still Open"

# Main loop for real-time monitoring
def monitor_trades():
    while True:
        # Load trade signals
        trade_signals = pd.DataFrame(sheet.get_all_records())

        for index, row in trade_signals.iterrows():
            symbol = row['Symbol']
            live_price = get_live_price(symbol)

            if live_price:
                outcome = check_trade_outcome(row, live_price)

                # If outcome is different from the current sheet status, update it
                if row.get("Outcome") != outcome:
                    sheet.update_cell(index + 2, trade_signals.columns.get_loc("Outcome") + 1, outcome)
                    print(f"Updated trade {row['Trade ID']} - {outcome}")

        time.sleep(10)  # Check every 10 seconds

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_trades()



⸻

Step 4: Running the App on Replit
	1.	Upload your google_api_credentials.json.
	2.	Modify the MARKET_DATA_API with your preferred live market data source.
	3.	Run the script:

python real_time_signals.py



⸻

How It Works
	1.	Pulls trade signals from Google Sheets (Entry, SL, TP, Symbol).
	2.	Fetches live market prices for each trade.
	3.	Checks if Stop Loss or Take Profit is hit first.
	4.	Updates the Google Sheet in real time when SL or TP is reached.
	5.	Repeats every 10 seconds to monitor all active trades.

⸻

Bonus Enhancements for Trade Hybrid App

1. Integrate Directly with NinjaTrader
	•	Replace MARKET_DATA_API with NinjaTrader’s live market data feed.

2. Add Notifications
	•	Send email, Discord, or SMS alerts when TP/SL is hit.

3. Visual Dashboard
	•	Show live trade tracking inside your Trade Hybrid web app.

This will automate trade tracking in real time! Let me know if you need help integrating NinjaTrader or TradingView data into this system.
