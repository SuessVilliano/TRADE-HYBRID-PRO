Game Structure: Bulls vs. Bears

Game Modes
	1.	Single-Player (AI-Generated Market)
	•	Players trade against an AI-driven market.
	•	Dynamic difficulty with market patterns that become more complex.
	•	Missions and challenges (e.g., “Make 5 correct trades in a row”).
	2.	Multiplayer (PvP Trading Battles)
	•	Players compete in real-time with the same market conditions.
	•	Highest accuracy wins (scored based on correct buy/sell decisions).
	•	Private lobbies and ranked matchmaking.
	3.	Live Market Mode
	•	Players trade real-time price action from real-world data.
	•	Used for both demo trading and competitive play.

Game Rules & Levels
	•	Round-Based Trading: Players get a fixed time (e.g., 30s, 60s, 90s) to make buy/sell decisions.
	•	Scoring System:
	•	Correct trades = points.
	•	Streaks multiply rewards.
	•	Wrong trades reset streak bonuses.
	•	Level Progression: Unlock new features and perks as players improve.
	•	Beginner: Slower price movement, simple trends.
	•	Intermediate: Faster market, candlestick patterns, moving averages.
	•	Advanced: News-driven volatility, trend reversals, hidden clues.

What Needs to Be Built on Replit
	1.	Game Engine Setup (Three.js, Babylon.js, or Unity WebGL for 3D)
	•	Create a 3D trading interface with a price chart animation.
	•	Implement real-time buy/sell buttons with response feedback.
	2.	AI Market Generator
	•	Write a price movement algorithm using Python (NumPy, Pandas) or JavaScript.
	•	Implement confluence-based hints (e.g., support/resistance, trend strength).
	3.	Multiplayer & Leaderboards
	•	Use Replit’s multiplayer backend (Node.js with WebSockets or Firebase).
	•	Store player scores, track performance, and enable matchmaking.
	4.	Live Data API Integration
	•	Connect to TradingView, Binance, or Alpha Vantage APIs for real-time data.
	•	Allow switching between AI-generated markets and live data.
	5.	Trade Hybrid Coin Integration
	•	Use Solana smart contracts for token-based rewards.
	•	Implement staking and in-game purchases.
