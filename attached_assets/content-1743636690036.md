CrossTraders, we want to share an exciting update. [**CrossTrade**](https://crosstrade.io/?ref=crosstrade.io/blog) (part of the NinjaTrader ecosystem) just released the brand [new CrossTrade NT8 Add-On](https://crosstrade.io/blog/crosstrades-new-ninjatrader-add-on/?ref=crosstrade.io/blog), and with it comes a **fully-functional REST API for NinjaTrader**.

We're not native C#/.NET programmers and it's not our first choice of language, so coding in NinjaScript is honestly a pain.

If you're algotraders like us, you most likely have data sources you're analyzing outside of NinjaTrader as well. We wanted a way to execute through NT8 while being able to send orders from any code or 3rd-party service, anywhere in the world, directly to our NT8 desktop application. Now you can code autotrading bots in Python, Javascript, Java, Go, or even assembly!

## Getting Started

[Installation](https://docs.crosstrade.io/getting-started/installation?ref=crosstrade.io/blog) is as simple as installing any other NT8 Add-On. As long as the Add-On is connected, you're live.

The CrossTrade client must be connected for the API to be functional.

## Interacting with the API

The REST API is the same underlying functionality CrossTrade uses to execute orders from inbound webhook requests from TradingView. It's battle-tested and used to execute hundreds of thousands of orders in NT8 every day.

Anyone with a CrossTrade account can use the API to access information about your NT8 accounts, positions, orders, strategies, executions, and even instrument quotes.

Each CrossTrade account is given a Secret Key, which can be used to both authenticate inbound alert messages from TradingView, for instance, or as a Bearer token to interact with the API.

This is how easy it is to send your first API request to quote the ES 12-24 contract in Python:

```Python
url = "https://app.crosstrade.io/v1/api/accounts/sim101/quote"
headers = {
  "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
}
params = {
  "instrument": "ES 12-24"
}
try:
  response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
  print(f"Response Code: {response.status_code}, Response Text: {response.text}")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Summer 2024 Updates Recap

For non-developers, we also released a bunch of enhancements to the webhook functionality, including the ability to require market position before execution, setting a max number of positions allowed at one time, and the option to set trading windows per-alert message.
