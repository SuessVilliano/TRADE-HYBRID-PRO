Project: Trade Hybrid - 3D First-Person Survival Trading Game

Overview

Trade Hybrid is a 3D first-person survival trading game where players navigate real-world markets, execute trades, and compete in a global leaderboard. The game is fully integrated with real broker APIs, trade signals, and copy trading features, allowing users to connect demo or live accounts, trade in real time, and share their trading performance publicly or privately.

The game must be optimized for mobile and desktop, feature customizable players, and include a 2D game version for additional gameplay elements.
