Subject: Trade Hybrid – Required Edits & Updates

Hello,

We’ve deployed Trade Hybrid and need the following updates and fixes implemented across the platform:

1. Trade Dashboard Fixes
	•	Panels currently free-move but do not lock into place when rearranged. Implement a snap-to-grid or docking system so panels align properly.
	•	When adding multiple panels (e.g., Market News, Trading Bots, AI Assistance), they should be draggable and reorderable without forcing all new panels to stack below the existing ones.
	•	Users should be able to customize their dashboard layout and save it, so changes persist even when switching symbols or refreshing the page.

2. Infinite Spillover Matrix Update
	•	Update the Infinite Spillover Matrix percentage to reflect the correct 2.5% / 1.25% values instead of the outdated 2.5% / 1.5%.
	•	Ensure that affiliate and matrix calculations display the correct figures.

3. Metaverse Enhancements
	•	We recently embedded Spatial and plan to upgrade it.
	•	Ensure the Web SDK is fully functional and that our teleportation system integrates correctly with real locations once built.

4. Learning/Course Section Fix
	•	The Course Catalog currently fails to fetch courses, displaying a “fail to fetch courses” error.
	•	Ensure courses load properly so students can enroll and complete lessons within the platform.

5. Events Section
	•	Events should persist after creation until they are manually deleted. Ensure they are not disappearing unexpectedly.

6. Trade Runner Fix (Games Section)
	•	The Trade Runner game currently does not launch, and the site crashes when attempting to access it.
	•	The URL is missing—fix the pop-up so it correctly loads Trade Runner instead of displaying a static image.

7. Affiliate Dashboard Issue
	•	The Affiliate section only shows a “Connect Wallet” button but does not load a dashboard.
	•	Ensure that users can access their affiliate dashboard after connecting their wallet.

8. Footer Cleanup
	•	The footer currently has duplicate “2025 Trade Hybrid – All Rights Reserved” sections.
	•	Merge footer elements into a single line, including Terms, Privacy, and Contact links.

These fixes should improve user experience and ensure all sections function as intended. Please let me know once these updates are deployed or if any additional clarification is needed.

Thanks,
