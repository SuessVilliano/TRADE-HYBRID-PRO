Absolutely, let’s break it down step-by-step as if I’m troubleshooting it for you!

1. Verify the Webhook URL in TradingView:
	•	Ensure the webhook URL in TradingView is correctly set to the endpoint of your Replit app.
	•	Double-check that the URL is public and not a local or private endpoint.

2. Check Replit App’s Listening Port:
	•	Confirm that your Replit app is listening on the correct port and that the endpoint matches the one you’ve set in TradingView.
	•	Make sure the app is not running in a sandbox mode that restricts incoming webhooks.

3. Validate Incoming Data:
	•	Add logging to the endpoint in your Replit app to verify that the webhook is indeed hitting the app.
	•	Check the logs to see if the data from TradingView is being received correctly.

4. Ensure Proper Data Parsing:
	•	Confirm that the format of the data coming from TradingView matches what your app expects. If there’s a mismatch in the fields or data structure, the app might not display anything.
	•	If needed, add a temporary endpoint that just returns the received data so you can see what’s coming in.

5. Frontend Display Check:
	•	Verify that the frontend of your Replit app is correctly rendering the data. If the data is coming in but not visible, it might be a frontend rendering issue.
	•	Ensure that the UI components are properly hooked up to the data source.

6. API Integration for Copy-Trading:
	•	Ensure that the broker APIs are fully authenticated and that the app has the right permissions to execute trades.
	•	Test the API calls in isolation to ensure they work as expected before integrating them into the app.

7. Debugging and Testing:
	•	Use tools like Postman to simulate the webhook and see if the Replit app responds correctly.
	•	Temporarily simplify the logic to just display raw data so you can confirm the data flow.

What I Need from You:
	•	Confirm the exact URL endpoint you’re using and if it’s publicly accessible.
	•	Share any sample data that’s being sent from TradingView (if possible) so I can see the format.
	•	Let me know the exact behavior you see in the app right now (any partial data, empty screen, etc.).

With these details, we can pinpoint the exact issue and get everything working smoothly!
