Trade Hybrid App - Replit QA Issues & Fixes Needed

1. Trade Dashboard (Desktop & Mobile Issues)
	•	The trading chart is too small (about 1 inch wide) and cannot be resized. Improve visibility and allow users to expand it.
	•	On mobile (Advanced Trading Dashboard), the top UI elements obstruct the view—prioritize making the trading chart fully visible.
	•	Settings button doesn’t function.
	•	Deposit button shouldn’t be there—remove it.
	•	No way to return to the dashboard—add a bottom navigator (similar to the DEX page where it works).

2. Trading Signals & Webhooks
	•	Webhook signals are not coming in real-time. You mentioned setting up a custom webhook URL system—ensure we can send, receive, and create signals properly.
	•	I will run a separate webhook test to verify if our system is receiving data properly.

3. Smart Trade Panel & Navigation Issues
	•	Trade dashboard layout needs major improvements.
	•	No header icons for navigation—on desktop, restore the top header with navigation options.
	•	Inconsistent navigation across pages—users cannot move between sections smoothly.

4. Trading Bot & Signals Analyzer
	•	Trading Bot page is blank—does not load.
	•	Signals Analyzer page doesn’t open—consider removing it if non-functional.

5. Voice Trade Agent
	•	The voice command feature listens but does not process input when the stop button is pressed. The “Process” button does not work.
	•	No way to navigate back after using the voice trade agent.

6. Market News & Data Feeds
	•	Market News page leads to a black screen.
	•	RSS feed is missing—restore real-time market data that was previously visible.
	•	Market Data page no longer shows expected information—this data was working before but is now missing.

7. Copy Trader & Learning Center Issues
	•	Copy Trader is missing—this feature was expected but is not present.
	•	Learning Center Issues:
	•	Some courses return “Page Not Found”.
	•	Certificates page leads to a 404 error.
	•	Learning Journal leads to a 404 error.
	•	Podcast link works correctly—this functions as expected.
	•	Icons/images in the Learning Center do not display.

8. Trade Runner (Game) & Bulls vs. Bears
	•	Trade Runner opens a “404 Page Not Found” error—the provided HTML code is not being used correctly.
	•	Bulls vs. Bears game loads but is unplayable—
	•	No interactive elements.
	•	No clear instructions.
	•	Remove it unless functionality can be improved.

9. NFT Marketplace & Wallet Balances
	•	NFT creation works, and wallet connects, but:
	•	Wallet balance is incorrect.
	•	The system should fetch and display actual token balances.
	•	Solana & Morales are connected, so it should pull live wallet data.

10. Prop Firm Dashboard & Challenge Page
	•	Profit target and max drawdown values are incorrect:
	•	Profit Target should be 10%, not 1,000.
	•	Max Drawdown should be 5%, not 500,000.
	•	Prop Firm Challenge page does not load—the toggle is non-functional.
	•	Profile page does not show stats, achievements, progress, or activity—should sync dynamically with user data.

11. Settings & Theme Toggle Issues
	•	Settings page is a blank white screen.
	•	No navigation options to go back from the settings page.
	•	Light/Dark theme toggle does not work—fix theme-switching functionality.

12. Quick Actions (Bottom Menu) - All Broken
	•	Connect Broker does not work.
	•	Tutorial does not work.
	•	Import Trades does not work.
	•	Discord link does not work.

Final Note
	•	Fix all listed issues to ensure seamless functionality.
	•	Prioritize trading chart resizing, real-time signals, navigation fixes, and broken pages.
	•	Remove or replace non-functional features as needed.
