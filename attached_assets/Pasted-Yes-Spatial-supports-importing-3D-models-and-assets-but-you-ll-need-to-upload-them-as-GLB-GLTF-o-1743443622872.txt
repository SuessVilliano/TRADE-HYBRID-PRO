Yes, Spatial supports importing 3D models and assets, but you‚Äôll need to upload them as GLB, GLTF, or FBX files rather than pasting raw code. However, if you want to script interactivity, you can use Spatial‚Äôs Unity SDK or Web SDK to code elements into your world.

Here‚Äôs What You Need to Do Next

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Blender or Unity to create a 3D model of your Trade Hybrid Metaverse Office.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Export as GLB/GLTF and upload to Spatial.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Spatial‚Äôs Web SDK or Unity SDK to add interactive elements like live charts, AI assistants, and trading terminals.
