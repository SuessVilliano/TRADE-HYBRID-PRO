### 2. Import the NinjaScript into NinjaTrader

1. Open NinjaTrader 8
2. Click on the "Tools" menu

3. Find "Trade Hybrid Connector" in the list
4. Check the box to enable it
5. The connector window should appear on your screen

### 4. Configure the Connector

In the connector window:

1. **Port**: By default, the connector runs on port 8081. You can change this if needed.
2. **API Key**: For security, set an API key that will be required for all API calls.
3. **Account**: Select the NinjaTrader account you want to use for trading.

### 5. Connect Trade Hybrid to NinjaTrader

1. Log in to your Trade Hybrid account
2. Go to "Broker Connections" in the settings
3. Click "Add NinjaTrader Connection"
4. Enter the following information:

   - API Key: The same key you set in the connector
   - Account: Your NinjaTrader account name (optional)
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify everything is working
6. Save the connection

## Using the Connector

Once installed and configured, the connector will:

1. Run in the background of NinjaTrader
2. Listen for trade signals from Trade Hybrid
3. Execute trades in your NinjaTrader account
4. Display a log of all received signals and trade executions

Keep the connector window open while you want to receive signals from Trade Hybrid.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**: Make sure NinjaTrader is running and the connector is enabled. Check that the port is not blocked by your firewall.

2. **API Key Errors**: Ensure the API key in Trade Hybrid matches exactly what you set in the connector.

3. **Order Execution Failures**: Verify that your NinjaTrader account is properly set up and connected to your broker.

4. **Instrument Not Found**: Make sure the symbol format used in Trade Hybrid matches what NinjaTrader expects.
