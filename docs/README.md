# Trade Hybrid Platform Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Trade Hybrid platform architecture and implementation.

## Documentation Index

### Overview
- [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md) - High-level overview of the platform architecture and implementation approach
- [Architecture](architecture.md) - Detailed architecture of the Trade Hybrid platform

### Implementation
- [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md) - Phased approach to implementing the platform
- [Technical Requirements](technical-requirements.md) - Detailed technical specifications for each component
- [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md) - Comprehensive testing approach for the platform

### Visual Resources
- [Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.txt) - ASCII representation of the platform architecture

### Migration
- [Migration Guide](migration-guide.md) - Instructions for migrating to the Hetzner EX101 server

## Documentation Purpose

This documentation suite serves multiple purposes:

1. **Blueprint for Implementation**: Provides a detailed plan for building the platform
2. **Reference for Developers**: Serves as a reference for development teams
3. **Guide for Operations**: Outlines deployment and maintenance procedures
4. **Documentation for Stakeholders**: Communicates architecture decisions and approach

## Using This Documentation

- **For Executives**: Start with the [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md)
- **For Architects**: Review the [Architecture](architecture.md) document
- **For Developers**: Use the [Technical Requirements](technical-requirements.md) and [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md)
- **For QA Teams**: Reference the [Testing Strategy](testing-strategy.md)
- **For DevOps**: Consult the [Migration Guide](migration-guide.md)

## Documentation Maintenance

These documents should be treated as living documents and updated as the platform evolves:

1. Major architectural changes should be reflected in the architecture document
2. Implementation timeline adjustments should update the implementation plan
3. Technical specification changes should update the technical requirements
4. Testing approach changes should update the testing strategy

All documentation updates should be version-controlled alongside code changes.
