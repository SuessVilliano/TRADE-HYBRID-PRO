## Platform Architecture

### Modular Service Structure

The Trade Hybrid platform is built with a modular architecture consisting of multiple independent services:

    └── Platform Analytics
```

Each service is containerized with Docker and can be deployed and scaled independently. This architecture enables:

- Independent development cycles for each component
- Targeted scaling based on demand
- Fault isolation between services
- Simplified maintenance and updates

### Data Flow Architecture

The platform's data flows through several key pathways:

1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - User connects wallet (Phantom or Web3Auth)
   - Authentication service verifies wallet signature
   - Session token issued for API access
   - User data linked via Whop ID

2. **Trading Signal Flow**:
   - Signals received from TradingView via webhooks
   - AI analysis enhances signal with additional data
   - Signals stored in database with metadata
   - Signals displayed to users based on access level

3. **Trade Execution Flow**:
   - User selects signal to execute
   - Nexus service routes to appropriate broker
   - Order executed through broker API
   - Confirmation returned to user interface

4. **Blockchain Transaction Flow**:
   - User initiates transaction (stake, purchase, etc.)
   - Frontend creates transaction with wallet adapter
   - User signs transaction with connected wallet
   - Transaction submitted to Solana network
   - Confirmation monitored and displayed to user

## Key Components

### 1. User Authentication and Profile

The platform uses a hybrid authentication system:

- **Wallet-based Authentication**: Primary method using Phantom or other Solana wallets
- **Web3Auth Integration**: Alternative method for users without crypto wallets
- **Whop ID Integration**: Master identifier that links all user data

The UserDataContext provides a unified profile that includes:

- Connected wallets and balances
- Trading preferences and history
- Learning progress and achievements
- Affiliate network status
- Subscription details

### 2. Nexus Trading System

Formerly known as ABATEV, the Nexus system is the core trading engine that:

- Connects to multiple brokers (Alpaca, Binance, MetaTrader, etc.)
- Executes trades based on user selection
- Manages open positions across brokers
- Provides risk management tools
- Processes signals from various sources

The system maintains backward compatibility with the previous ABATEV implementation while adding enhanced features and improved reliability.

### 3. Blockchain Integration

The platform deeply integrates with the Solana blockchain:

- **Wallet Connections**: Support for multiple wallet providers

- Multiple staking periods (30/60/90/180 days)
- Compounding rewards option
- Staking performance analytics

#### SOL Staking
- Delegate SOL to the platform's validator
- 1% commission rate
- Validator account: 5Mp3EF1donYwLxhe5hs6HoWpAucZGLZ76NKRNztkjEej
